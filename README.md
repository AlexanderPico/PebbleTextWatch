Pebble Text Watch - Japanese (Romanji)
======================================

The Japanese (Romanji) version of the [Pebble Text Watch project](https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch). This version shows hours (ji) and minutes (fun) in romanji text, just as you would speak it in Japanese. Just add "Ima" to the beginning and "desu" to the end and you'll have a complete sentence. For example, "Ima, kyu ji san ju nana fun desu" translates to "It's now nine thirty-six". All the Japanese words between "Ima" and "desu" are provided by the watchface.

***This is particularly useful watchface if you are learning Japanese!***
